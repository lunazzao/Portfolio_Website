            Hi! My name is Luna and I consider myself to be a future full-stack
            software engineer with an eye for design. I have several internships
            as full stack software engineer at Amazon Robotics and Arista
            Networks, as well as Web/UIUX at AIA. I pride myself on being more
            than just a developer; my background in design, which played a
            pivotal role during my time at AIA Group, is a testament to my
            passion for creating <b>intuitive and user-friendly </b>
            applications. Whether working on backend development or UI design, I
            constantly strive to build solutions that are not only robust and
            scalable but also visually appealing and user-centric.
          </p>
          <p className="hero--section-description">
            As I look forward to the next step in my career, I am eager to find
            a role where I can continue to grow and develop as a full-stack
            software engineer. I thrive in environments that foster teamwork,
            collaboration, and mentorship, and I am excited about the
            opportunity to apply my knowledge and skills to contribute to your
            team while learning from experienced professionals in the field.
